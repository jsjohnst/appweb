Linux Release Details
---------------------

Installing Embedthis Appweb

The installation distribution includes sub-packages containing pre-built 
binaries, development libraries, headers, documentation and samples. You can 
selectively install the sub-packages or you can install the complete 
distribution.

For those looking to build from source code, you will need to download the 
separate source code distribution. The product documentation describes how 
to build from source. 

The Embedthis Appweb install distribution for LINUX is published in three 
formats:

    * Debian (*.deb) format for debian distributions including Ubuntu

    * RPM (*.rpm) format for RPM distributions including Fedora and RHEL

    * Tar format for custom installs.

It is recommended that you use the RPM or Debian formats if your system 
supports those package standards.

    * The Debian package is: appweb-VERSION-NUMBER-LINUX-i386.deb.tar.gz

    * The RPM package is: appweb-VERSION-NUMBER-LINUX-i386.rpm.tar.gz

    * The tar install package is: appweb-VERSION-NUMBER-LINUX-i386.tar.tar.gz

The RPM and Debian formats will register the software installation with the
system's package manager so that you can query, verify, and easily manage the
software on your system. 

The tar format consists of tar archives that you can manually extract for
maximum control over the placement of the product files. You can however,
still use the install script with the tar install distribution if 
your system does not support RPM.

To install the Linux RPM package:

   1. If you are installing the binary package, you will need to login as 
       root or attain root privilege when you execute the install script.

   2. Uncompress and extract the top level files by typing

      tar xvfz appweb-VERSION-NUMBER-LINUX-i386.rpm.tar.gz

   3. ./install

   4. If required, edit /etc/appweb.conf to suit your environment and then 
      restart Appweb via:

      service appweb restart


To install the Linux Debian package:

   1. If you are installing the binary package, you will need to login as 
      root or attain root privilege via sudo when you execute the install
      script.

   2. Uncompress and extract the top level files by typing

      tar xvfz appweb-VERSION-NUMBER-LINUX-i386.deb.tar.gz

   3. Install the package via:

      dpkg -i appweb-VERSION-NUMBER-LINUX-i386.deb

   4. If required, edit /etc/appweb.conf to suit your environment and then 
      restart Appweb via:

      invoke-rc.d appweb restart


To install the Linux Tar Package:

   1. If you are installing the binary package, you will need to login as root 
      or attain root privilege when you execute the install script.

   2. tar xvfz appweb-VERSION-NUMBER-LINUX-i386.tar.tar.gz

   3. cd {Desired-Directory-For-Binaries}

   4. tar xvfz appweb-VERSION-NUMBER-LINUX-i386.tar.gz


Removing Embedthis Appweb

   1. Login as root

   2. Change directory to the installation directory for Appweb. This is 
      usually /etc/appweb

   3. Run the remove script in the install directory for Appweb by typing 

      ./remove

      or use your system removal tool. For RPM:

      rpm -e appweb

      or Debian:

      dpkg -r appweb


Running Appweb on Linux

The Appweb product installation will automatically start Appweb before it 
completes. Thereafter, Appweb will automatically start if the system is 
rebooted.

If you wish to stop Appweb, on Red Hat type:

    service appweb stop

    or on Debian, type:

    invoke-rc.d appweb stop

You can restart Appweb on Red Hat by:

    service appweb start

    or on Debian:

    invoke-rc.d appweb start

Alternatively, you may also run Appweb manually (once you have stopped the 
Appweb service as described above)

   1. cd /etc/appweb

   2. ./appweb -f appweb.conf -l stdout:2

Appweb is configured by default to listen on port 7777. To test that it is 
serving pages, point your browser at http://localhost:7777. To tailor the 
Embedthis Appweb configuration, including the default port, you may wish to 
edit the appweb.conf configuration file. The -l switch directs logging 
output to the standard output (stdout) at level 2. Levels range between 0
and 9 with zero being the least verbose.


Windows Release Details
-----------------------

The installation distribution includes sub-packages containing pre-built

and samples distribution in the one package. During installation you will have 
the option of installing the full package or just the binary or documentation 
and samples.

   2. Display the contents of Programs > Embedthis Appweb under the Start menu.

   3. Select Embedthis Appweb. The application will be started and its icon 
      will appear in the status area of the Windows taskbar. This is actually 
      starting appweb. You can double click on the appweb icon to launch
      a browser.


To Run Appweb from the Console

   1. Select Run from the Start menu and browse to the location holding the 
      Embedthis Appweb installation. Browse to the App web program which by
      default is in C:/Program Files/Embedthis Appweb/bin/appweb.exe. Select 
      the appweb.exe program.

   2. Add -f appweb.conf to the end of the command line

   3. Click OK
