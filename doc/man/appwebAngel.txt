NAME
       appwebAngel - Embedded HTTP Server

SYNOPSIS
       appwebAngel  [--args  arguments]  [--console]  [--daemon]  [--heartBeat
       interval] [--home directory] [--install] [--log logFile:level]  [--pro-

DESCRIPTION
       The  appwebAngel  program  is  a  guardian angel process for Appweb. It
       watches over Appweb to start it and restart  it  should  it  fail.  The
       angel  is  a  robust,  minimal  program with one job - to ensure Appweb
       remains available.

OPTIONS
       --args arguments
              Arguments to use for the Appweb command line when it starts.

       --console
              Windows specific option to allow the Angel process  to  interact
              with the users desktop.

       --daemon
              Run  the  Angel  as  a  daemon process. This causes the Angel to
              detach from the current shell and run in the background.

       --heartBeat interval
              Set the frequency in seconds for the Angel to check  on  Appweb.
              This  period  should be short enough that Appweb will be quickly
              restarted should it fail,  but  not  so  short  that  the  Angel
              process consumes significant CPU resources.  If Appweb dies more
              than 15 times per hour, the Angel will suspend  restarting  App-
              web.

       --home directory
              Set the home directory in which to start Appweb.

       --install
              Windows  specific  option to install the Angel as a windows ser-
              vice.

       --l logFile:level
              Specify a file to use  for  log  messages.  The  level  argument
              defines  the  message  verbosity. Zero is the least and 9 is the
              most verbose.

       --program path
              Define the Appweb program path to execute.

       --stop Windows specific option to stop the Angel service.

       --start
              Windows specific option to start the Angel service.

       --uninstall
              Windows specific option to uninstall the Angel as a windows ser-
              vice.

       -v     Output the product version number.
