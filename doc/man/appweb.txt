DESCRIPTION
       Appweb  is  a  compact  embedded HTTP web server.  It is a fast, small-
       footprint, multi-threaded, standards-based, portable  server  developed
       for  use  by embedded devices and applications.  It can run as a stand-
       alone web server or the Appweb library can be embedded in applications.

       Appweb supports HTTP/1.1, SSL, digest and basic authentication, virtual
       hosting, ranged requests, chunked transfers, file upload  and  security
       limits.  Appweb has an Apache style configuration file and supports the
       PHP and Ejscript web frameworks.

       Appweb normally reads the appweb.conf  file  for  configuration  direc-
       tives.  However, if appweb is invoked with an IP address or port number
       on the command line, Appweb  will  not  read  the  configuration  file.
       Rather it will listen for requests on the specified IP:PORT address. If
       the PORT component is omitted, Appweb will listen on port 80. If the IP
       address  is  omitted  and a port is supplied, Appweb will listen on all
       network interfaces.

OPTIONS
       --config filename
              Define the name of the Appweb configuration  file.  This  is  by
              default appweb.

       --chroot directory
              Change  the  system  root  directory  for Appweb. This creates a
              chroot jail so that the Appweb process cannot access  any  files
              outside the given directory.

       --debug
              Run Appweb in debug mode and disable all timeouts. This disables
              request and session timeouts.  The -d option  is  an  alias  for
              --debug.

       --ejs name:directory
              Define  an  Ejscript application by name at the specified direc-
              tory. The name is the application name and is used as a URL pre-
              fix. When a request arrives which matches this URL prefix, it is
              routed to the application to service. For example:

              appweb --ejs /carmen/:/var/www/apps/carmen/

       --log logSpec
              Name the Appweb log file. This will override the ErrorLog direc-
              tive  in  the  configuration  file.   When  the  maximum size is
              exceeded, the log file will be rotated to logName.old and a  new
              log  file  will be started. The -l option is an alias for --log.
              The syntax is:

              --log logName[:logLevel][.maxSize]

       --home directory
              Define the server home directory for Appweb.

       --threads numThreads
              Specify the maximum number of threads  to  use  for  the  appweb
              thread  pool.  This overrides the ThreadLimit configuration file
              directive.

       --verbose
              Shorthand for --log stdout:4. The -v  option  is  an  alias  for
              --verbose.

       --version
              Output the product version number.
