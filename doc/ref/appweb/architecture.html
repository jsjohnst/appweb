            <p>The Appweb HTTP web server is a compact, modular, high-performance embedded web server. It supports an
            extensive feature set including: HTTP/1.1, TLS/SSL, CGI, PHP, Ejscript, Ruby, Virtual Hosts, Digest
            Authentication, Apache compatible configuration and logging and security sandboxing. Yet it remains very
            small (from 400K) and exceptionally fast (&gt; 4,000 requests per second).</p>
            <p>Appweb is Apache configuration compatible and supports leading web application frameworks like PHP,
            Ejscript, Perl and Ruby. It is an event-driven, multi-threaded web server and is able to support many
            thousands of requests per second but it does not try to scale up like Apache for top-tier web sites.
            Rather, it aims to be robust, secure and exceptionally fast with low memory utilization.</p><a name=
            "deployment" id="deployment"></a>
            <h2 class="section">Deployment Models</h2>
            <p>Appweb can be deployed in several ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>As a stand-alone web server</li>
                <li>Embedded in applications and devices</li>
                <li>Proxied behind front-end web servers</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Stand-Alone Web Server</h3>
            <p>The Appweb distribution contains a robust, secure, stand-alone web server. The binary installation will
            install this web server to be automatically started as a system daemon/service. It is supervised by an
            Angel process which acts as a guardian to start, monitor and restart Appweb if required.</p>
            <h3>Embedded in Applications and Devices</h3>
            <p>Appweb provides an embeddable server and client library so that any application can be web-enabled. When
            embedded, the application can provide data and respond to requests over HTTP. For devices, Appweb can be
            configured with the minimal required set of features for minimal memory and security footprint.</p>
            <h3>Proxied</h3>
            <p>Appweb is an ideal application web server when running behind a reverse proxy such as Apache. The
            reverse proxy dispatches incoming requests to a set of Appweb instances which can effectively host
            Ejscript, PHP or Ruby applications.</p><img src="../../images/proxied.jpg" alt="" /> <a name="processing"
            id="processing"></a>
            <h2 class="section">Processing Architecture</h2>
            <p>Appweb runs typically as a single, multi-threaded, event driven process. Appweb uses a non-blocking
            event driven architecture and is capable of running many requests simultaneously.</p>
            <h3>Event Driven and Multi-threaded</h3>
            <p>While Appweb is multi-threaded, it does not consume a thread per request. A high performance thread pool
            is used to temporarily loan worker threads as required to service incoming requests. While waiting for
            incoming and outgoing I/O, the worker thread is returned to the pool for use by other requests. This
            architecture minimizes memory usage by reusing threads and provides excellent performance due to the thread
            pool. Further, it scales well as one thread can service many requests.</p><a name="modules" id=
            "modules"></a>
            <h2 class="section">Appweb Modules</h2>
            <p>Embeddable web servers have several competing goals:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Minimize memory footprint</li>
                <li>Minimize CPU consumption</li>
                <li>Maximize security</li>
                <li>Provide a strong and standard feature set</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To meet all these goals in one server is difficult. Appweb uses loadable modules so that the core Appweb
            HTTP server may be compact, secure and fast while still having the ability to grow functionality as
            required.</p>
            <p>An Appweb loadable module is a discrete unit of functionality that may be linked into Appweb to enhance
            the core HTTP server. A module may be a request handler, filter, network connector or simply a "lump" of
            code.</p>
            <h3>Core Components</h3>
            <p>Appweb has a modular architecture where modules are dynamically loaded at runtime depending on the
            desired configuration. The key components of Appweb are:</p>
            <p><img src="../../images/modules.jpg" alt="Appweb Architecture" /></p>

            <h3>Appweb HTTP Server Core</h3>
            <p>The core Appweb HTTP server is relatively one of the smaller components of the Appweb product when
            compared to the dynamic modules that run atop it. The core server provides a set of services for the
            handlers, filters and connectors to use when serving content to clients. The goal is to centralize any
            facilities for the modules so it will not be replicated.</p>
            <p>The core services include: the main HTTP processing and socket communications, initialization and
            parsing the Appweb configuration file, server, virtual host and directory authorization management, request
            pipeline management and request processing.</p>
            <p>The core server also configures and enforces any sandbox resource limits that have been requested in the
            configuration file, for example: thread limits and request URL and body size limitations. This enables
            Appweb to be deterministic in its use of system resources and to be a good system citizen. The core Appweb
            server can be configured to execute single or multi-threaded. With appropriate sandbox limits, it can serve
            thousands of requests per second if required.</p><a name="configuration" id="configuration"></a>
            <h2 class="section">Appweb Configuration</h2>
            <p>Appweb uses an Apache style configuration file. This configuration file is read when Appweb starts and
            it manages every aspect of Appweb's configuration including what ports and addresses to listen to, what
            modules to load, where to find the web pages and how to log requests.</p>
            <p>The configuration file supports a wide variety of directives such as virtual hosting, directory
            authentication, port binding, aliasing, logging and request pipeline configuration. It has conditional
            declarations and supports the inclusion of sub-configuation files. Appweb uses a one-pass traversal of the
            configuration file which means that the order of directives matters.</p><a name="requests" id=
            "requests"></a>
            <h2 class="section">Request Processing</h2><!--
        - Header parsing
        - Request Matching
            - By extension
            - By location block

        - Keep alive
        -->
            <p>The Appweb HTTP core manages the processing of requests and the construction of the request processing
            pipeline. When a new HTTP request arrives, Appweb will examine the network interface on which the request
            arrived and if it is assigned to an IP based virtual host, Appweb will route the request to be handled by
            that virtual host. If name based virtual hosting is configured, the determination of which virtual host
            will process the request must be deferred until the HTTP header has been parsed and the default server is
            used to initially parse the request. See the <a href="vhosts.html">Virtual Hosts</a> for more
            information.</p>
            <h3>HTTP Header Parsing</h3>
            <p>The first line of the HTTP request specifies the HTTP operation method to use, the URL to access and the
            variant of the HTTP protocol to use. This typically looks like:</p>
            <pre>
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
</pre>
            <p>This example is asking for the /index.html document via the GET method using the HTTP/1.1 protocol.</p>
            <p>After the request line, follow a set of HTTP headers. Typically there are 5-15 headers which specify
            further information to help the server process the request. Headers are of the format:</p>
            <pre>
HeaderName: value
</pre>
            <p>Some typical headers are:</p>

                    cached copies of a document (or graphics) use this header to allow the server to skip copying the

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>KEEP-ALIVE</td>
                    <td>Request the server to keep the connection alive so that subsequent requests can reuse the
                    connection.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>For example:</p>
            <pre>
Connection: keep-alive
</pre>
            <p>Appweb parses the HTTP headers and stores their values in a hash table for access by the request
            handlers and pipeline stages. When all the headers have been processed Appweb proceeds to do handler
            matching. This will occur before any associated POST data has been read from the client. POST data may be
            form data submitted by the client or it may be a file upload using the PUT method.</p>
            <h3>Handler Matching</h3>
            <p>Appweb has a powerful handler matching algorithm that is adaptable to most requirements. Handlers may
            match requests based on the URL extension or on the leading portion of a URL (called prefix matching). Both
            forms are specified per handler in the Appweb configuration file.</p>
            <p>To associate a handler to a given extension, use the <a href=
            "../../guide/appweb/users/dir/location.html#addHandler">AddHandler</a> directive. For example:</p>
            <pre>
AddHandler espHandler .myDoc
</pre>
            <p>This will cause the ejsHandler to respond to any URL that has a ".myDoc" extension.</p>
            <p>To associate a handler with a URL prefix, use the <a href=
            "../../guide/appweb/users/dir/dir.html#location">Location</a> directive. For example:</p>
            <pre>
&lt;Location /projects/video&gt;
    SetHandler videoHandler
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>
            <p>This will cause the videoHandler to respond to any URL that begins with "/projects/video" after the
            http://site portion of the URL.</p>
            <p>Multiple handlers may match a URL. In this case they are applied in the order they are specified in the
            Appweb configuration file. In the default configuration, the fileHandler is specified last, without any
            extension and it thus becomes a catch-all. It will process any document not matched by other handlers and
            it will return the document without processing back to the client.</p>
            <p>Once the handlers have been matched, the request pipeline is constructed and run.</p><a name="pipeline"
            id="pipeline"></a>
            <h2 class="section">Request Pipeline</h2>
            <p>The Appweb core uses a bi-direction pipeline to process requests and generate responses. This consists
            of a mechanism of queues, packets, buffering and event scheduling. The pipeline architecture is highly
            optimized and supports the efficient transmission of data without copying. It uses vectored, scatter/gather
            writes to the network to avoid the costly aggregation of data and headers in a single buffer before writing
            to the network.</p>
            <h3>Pipeline Stages</h3>
            <p>The request pipeline is comprised of an incoming and outgoing stream. Each stream is in turn comprised
            of <b>stages</b>. Each stage has a data queue with two service routines, one to accept data without queuing
            and one for delayed servicing of previously queued data. Pipeline stages support flow-control and can queue
            data for delayed servicing if the downstream stage cannot currently accept data.</p><img src=
            "../../images/pipeline.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>A typical pipeline consists of the following <b>stages</b>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>One handler</li>
                <li>Zero or more filters</li>
                <li>One network connector</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Appweb HTTP core is responsible for parsing the incoming HTTP request and for creating the request
            pipeline. A new request pipeline is established for each request. Depending on the request type, a
            different handler may be required. There are handlers for PHP, CGI, Ejscript and static file data. The
            incoming and outgoing pipelines are constructed separately as each direction may require a different set of
            filters. After processing, generating and filtering the data, it is the job of the network connector to
            transmit the response to the client.</p>
            <h3>Handlers</h3>
            <p>The handler is responsible for receiving the request and creating a response. It generates response
            content based on the HTTP request URI, headers, any associated body data and potential application session
            state. The output data flows through the output pipeline before transmission by the network connector to
            the client.</p>
            <p>There is one handler for each request. The Appweb core selects that handler based on a request matching
            algorithm. Handlers are configured in the Appweb configure file via the <a href=
            "../../guide/appweb/users/dir/location.html#addHandler">AddHandler</a> and the <a href=
            "../../guide/appweb/users/dir/location.html#setHandler">SetHandler</a> directives.</p>
            <h3>Filters</h3>
            <p>The filters job is to permute the data in some way and pass it on to the next stage in the pipeline.
            Filters connect one to another and multiple filters may be used in both the incoming and outgoing pipeline
            directions.</p>
            <p>The order of filters typically does matter. For example, compressing data before encrypting is not the
            same as encrypting then compressing. Appweb provides the <a href=
            "../../guide/appweb/users/dir/location.html#addInputFilter">AddInputFilter</a> and <a href=
            "../../guide/appweb/users/dir/location.html#addOutputFilter">AddOutputFilter</a> directives to assist in
            constructing filter pipelines.</p>
            <p>Appweb uses filters to implement Transfer Authorization, Chunk Encoding and HTTP Ranged requests. By
            using filters to implement these features, they automatically become available to all handlers and all
            content types.</p>
            <h4>Auth Filter</h4>
            <p>Appweb configures the Auth filter as the first filter of the incoming pipeline. If the accessing user is
            not authorized, the Auth filter will terminate processing of the request and send an authorization error
            back to the client via the outgoing pipeline. If the user is authorized, the Auth filter will do nothing
            further. Appweb will then proceed with pipeline processing.</p>
            <h3>Connectors</h3>
            <p>The connector is responsible for transmitting the outgoing data to the client. It receives a set of
            packets representing the data to send to the client. The connector is responsible for requesting the Appweb
            HTTP core to create a packet with the HTTP response headers. It is at this stage that Appweb can determine
            if the TCP/IP connection can be kept alive for subsequent requests on the same connection.</p>
            <h4>Delayed Headers</h4>
            <p>Connectors will receive an empty header packet which must first be filled with the HTTP response
            headers. By delaying the generation of the HTTP headers until the last possible moment, Appweb maximizes
            every opportunity to optimize the response and use the HTTP/1.1 Keep-Alive feature even for dynamically
            generated data.</p>
            <h4>Send Connector</h4>
            <p>If the File handler is communicating directly to the Send connector, it will optimize its operation by
            not reading the static file data. Rather, it will send empty packets to the Send connector which will use
            the operating system <b>sendfile</b> (or equivalent) primitive. This avoids reading the static file data
            into the Appweb user process.</p>
            <h4>Net Connector</h4>
            <p>The Net connector is a generalized network connector that can transmit content from any handler to the
            client. It supports vectored writes to avoid copying data when interleaving with HTTP, range or chunk
            headers.</p><a name="frameworks" id="frameworks"></a>
            <h2 class="section">Web Frameworks</h2>
            <p>Appweb supports in-memory modules for the Ejscript and PHP web application frameworks. These provide the
            highest levels of performance.</p>
            <p>Running application frameworks in-memory can affect system reliability. A flaw in the web application or
            framework can compromise Appweb. There are two ways to address this potential issue:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the Appweb Angel to monitor and restart Appweb if required.</li>
                <li>Use a reverse-proxy in front of Appweb to manage multiple Appweb instances.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Ejscript Web Framework</h3>
            <p>The Ejscript Web Framework was designed to make it easier to create dynamic web applications. It uses
            server-side JavaScript as the application language and provides provides an application generator,
            templating engine, a powerful Model/View/Controller framework and a library of Ajax view controls.</p>See
            the <a href="../../ejs/ref/ejs/webArchitecture.html">Ejscript Web Framework</a> for more details.
            <h3>PHP</h3>
            <p>PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for Web development
            and can be embedded into HTML. Appweb provides a fast, in-memory handler for the PHP web
            framework.</p><a name="security" id="security"></a>
            <h2 class="section">Security</h2>
            <p>Appweb provides a suite of measures designed to increase the security of your web server:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Secure Sockets Layer</li>
                <li>Authorization directives</li>
                <li>Sandbox directives</li>
                <li>MPR &mdash; secure portable runtime</li>
                <li>Angel monitoring process</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Secure Sockets</h4>
            <p>Appweb supports the OpenSSL and MatrixSSL SSL stacks. You can configure server and/or client
            certificate-based authentication. SSL and TLS are supported.</p>
            <h4>Authentication</h4>Appweb provides the Digest authentication mechanism and supports both file and
            PAM-based authentication backends.
            <h4>Sandboxing</h4>
            <p>Sandboxing is the term applied to running Appweb in a confined environment. Appweb has a set of
            configuration file directives that allow you to define a sandbox which limits the resources that Appweb may
            used for a given request. By using well defined sandbox directives, you can help ensure that your
            application and system will not be compromised by malicious requests.</p><a name="mpr" id="mpr"></a>
            <h2 class="section">Portable Runtime (MPR)</h2>
            <p>Appweb is built upon a portable runtime layer called the MPR. This layer insulates the rest of the
            product from the underlying platform and allows it to be highly portable to new operating systems or
            hardware.</p>
            <p>The MPR also provides a suite of services that facilitate the creation of high performance,
            multi-threaded management and server applications, including: thread and communications management, dynamic
            module loading, timers and logging.</p>
            <p>The MPR also provides a safer environment in which to program as it replaces C APIs that are prone to
            buffer overflows and other similar security exploits. The MPR includes a high performance, safe string
            library that supports a secure programming style.</p>
            <p>The MPR event processing mechanism can be easily integrated into existing applications. It supports
            single and multi-threaded architectures, polled or async event notification, POSIX select waiting and
            Windows message loops. When coupled with C and C++ APIs, API web can be easily integrated into most C/C++
            applications.</p>
            <p>The MPR uses a high performance memory allocator that provides slab and arena based allocations. When
            memory is allocated in the MPR, it is connected to a parent memory block, thus forming a tree of blocks.
            When a block is freed, all children blocks are automatically freed. When a request completes, one free
            operation releases all memory allocated by the request. This virtually eliminates memory leaks.</p>
            <p>The memory allocator uses arenas of virtual memory to eliminate internal memory fragmentation. Each
            request allocates memory out of a single virtual block (arena) of memory. This results in very fast
            allocations.</p><a name="misc" id="misc"></a>
            <h2 class="section">Misc Features</h2>
            <h3>IP Networking</h3>
            <p>Appweb fully supports both IPv4 and IPv6 for both server and client operations. You can configure Appweb
            to listen on both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.</p>
            <h2 class="section">Embedding APIs</h2>
            <p>The Appweb HTTP server library can be embedded in an application to web-enable that app. Appweb provides
            two levels of embedding:</p>
            <h3>One Line Embedding</h3>
            <p>Appweb can be embedded in one C statement. This will create a web server instance based on the given
            configuration file.:</p>
            <pre>
maRunWebServer("appweb.conf");
</pre>
            <h3>Expanded Control</h3>
            <p>Appweb also provides a detailed API so you can create an embedded web server instance and control
            virtual hosts, port binding, directory and location blocks and every other part of Appweb. See the <a href=
            "../../api/appweb.html">Appweb Native API</a> for full details.</p>
